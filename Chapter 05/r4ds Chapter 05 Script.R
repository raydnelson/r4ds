# 5.2 Filter rows with filter() -------------------------------------------

jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))

# Comparisons

filter(flights, month = 1)
filter(flights, month == 1)

sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
1 / 49 * 49 == 1

near(sqrt(2) ^ 2, 2)

# Logical operators

filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)

is.na(x)
 
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1) 
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)

# 5.2.4 Exercises

# 1 Find all flights that
# a.  Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)

# b.  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))

# c.  Were operated by United, American, or Delta
filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))

# d.  Departed in summer (July, August, or September)
filter(flights, month %in% 7:9)

# e.  Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late
filter(flights, !is.na(dep_delay), arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)

# f.  Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, dep_delay - arr_delay > 30)

# h.  Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400)

# 5.3 Arrange rows with arrange() -----------------------------------------

arrange(flights, year, month, day)

df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
arrange(df, desc(x))

# 5.3.1 Exercises

#1  How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start?
# (Hint: use is.na()).
arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_delay)), dep_delay)

#2  Sort flights to find the most delayed flights.
#   Find the flights that left earliest.
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
arrange(flights, dep_delay)

#3  Sort flights to find the fastest flights
arrange(flights, air_time)

#4  Which flights travelled the longest? Which travelled the shortest?
arrange(flights, desc(distance)) %>% select(distance, everything())
arrange(flights, distance) %>% select(distance, everything())


# 5.4  Select columns with select -----------------------------------------

select(flights, year, month, day)
select(flights, year:day)
select(flights, -(year:day))

select(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)

select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())

# 5.4.1 Exercises

#1  Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time,
#   and arr_delay from flights.
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))
select(flights, matches(flights, "^(dep|arr)_(time|delay)$"))

#2  What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times
#   in a select() call?
select(flights, year, month, day, year)

#3  What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction
#   with this vector?
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
select(flights, vars)
select(flights, vars %>% one_of())

# 4 Does the result of running the following code surprise you?
#   How do the select helpers deal with case by default?
#   How can you change that default?
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
select(flights, contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE))

# 5.5 Add new variables with mutate() -------------------------------------

flights_sml <- select(
  flights, 
  year:day,
  ends_with("delay"),

)

mutate(

  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)

  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)

# 5.5.1 Useful creation functions

# 5.5.2 Exercises

# 1 Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at,
#   but hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers.
#   Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes
#   since midnight.

#   What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?

#3  Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect
#   those three numbers to be related?
flights %>% select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay) %>% 
  mutate(dep_delay_new = dep_time %>% time2mins() - sched_dep_time %>% time2mins())

#4  Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function.
#   How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation
#   for min_rank().
flights %>%
  mutate(ranking = -dep_delay %>% 
           min_rank()) %>%

# 5.6.4 Useful Summary Functions

## Measures of location

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
    avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
  )

## Measures of spread

# Why is distance to some destinations more variable than to others?

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))

## Measures of rank

# When do the first and last flights leave each day?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first = min(dep_time),
    last = max(dep_time)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(first, last)

## Measures of position

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first_dep = first(dep_time), 
    last_dep = last(dep_time)
  )

not_cancelled %>%

  mutate(r = dep_time %>% desc() %>% min_rank()) %>% 
  filter(r %in% range(r)) %>% 
  select(year:day, dep_time, r)

# Counts

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carriers)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(carriers))

not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest)

not_cancelled %>% 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)

# Counts and proportions of logical values

# How many flights left before 5am? (these usually indicate delayed
# flights from the previous day)

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))

# What proportion of flights are delayed by more than an hour?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))

# Grouping by multiple variables

daily <- flights %>% group_by(year, month, day)
(per_day <- daily %>% summarise(flights = n()))

(per_month <- per_day %>% summarise(flights = sum(flights)))

(per_year <- per_month %>% summarise(flights = sum(flights)))

# 5.6.6 Ungrouping

daily %>% group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarise(flights = n())

daily %>% ungroup() %>% 
  summarise(flights = n())

# 5.6.7 Exercises

# 1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay
#   characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:

# a.  A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% 
#     of the time

# b.  A flight is always 10 minutes late.

# c.  A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50%
#     of the time.

# d.  99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.


# 5.7 Grouped mutates (and filters) ---------------------------------------

flights_sml %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)

popular_dests <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(n() > 365)
popular_dests

popular_dests %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
  select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)

# 5.7.1 Exercises

#1. Refer back to the lists of useful mutate and filtering functions. 
#   Describe how each operation changes when you combine it with grouping.

#2. Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?
  
#3. What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?
  
#4.  For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each, flight, 
#   compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.

#5. Delays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused
#   the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow
#   earlier flights to leave. Using lag() explore how the delay of a flight is
#   related to the delay of the immediately preceding flight.

#6. Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast?
#   (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the 
#   air time a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. 
#   Which flights were most delayed in the air?
  
#7. Find all destinations that are flown by at least two carriers. Use that
#   information to rank the carriers.

#8. For each plane, count the number of flights before the first delay of
#   greater than 1 hour.
