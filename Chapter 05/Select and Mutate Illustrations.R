## Selection
# Select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights


## Modulus calculations

# New data from with only dep_time and summarize the varaible

# Calculate the Number of Hours

# Calculate the Number of Minutes

# Combine minutes and hours and deal with 12 Midnight

# time conversion function

## Logarithmic Calculations
# Distance Traveled

# Create a data frame with distance and log base 10 of distance

# Boxplot of distance

# Boxplot of log distance



# Offsets by using lead and lag
(x <- 1:10)

# Lag

# Lead

# Cumulataive sum, product, min, max, mean


# Logical comparisons
# New variable delayed which is true or false


# Ranking
# Data
y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4)

# Minimum rank


# Minimum rank descending
