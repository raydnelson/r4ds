## Lumping together factors

```{r computer optimum}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(relig, fill = relig)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE)
```

```{r user specified}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig, n = 10)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(relig %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev(), fill = relig)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Protestants are the largest group",
    x = "Religion",
    y = "Number of Respondents"
  )
