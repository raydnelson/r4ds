```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Concepts  

Carefully explain the following:  

1.  The two elements that define the distribution of a random variable  

2.  How the mean measures the location of a distribution  

3.  How the standard deviation measures the scale or spread of a distribution  

## Interpretation 

Interpret the following R code:  

```{r code chunk interpretation}
flights %>%
  group_by(day, month) %>%
  summarize(cancelled = mean(is.na(dep_time)) * 100,
            delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = delay, y = cancelled)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = "red")
```

## Coding Problems

1.  Create a new data frame that excludes canceled flights.

This data frame should have 327346 observations.

```{r exclude cancelled flights}

```  

2.  For the not cancelled flights, rank carriers from best to worst by their average arrival delays. Count the number of flights for each carrier.

```{r carrier ranking}

```

3.  For the not cancelled flights, rank carriers from best to worst by their on time percentage as measured by the arrival delay. Count the number of flights for each carrier.

```{r time percentage}

```
