```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Concepts  

1.  Explain the differences among "=", "==", and "<-". Give an example of how you would use each of these symbols.

1.  Compare and contrast the logical operators "x & y" and "xor(x, y)".

## Interpretation

```{r code chunk}
flights %>%
  filter(month == 5 | month == 9, carrier == "DL") %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = as.factor(month),
    y = dep_delay,
    fill = as.factor(month)
  )) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(origin))
```

## Coding Problem

Air time and distance travelled are undoubtedly positively related. Investigate this relationship for all April flights from JFK.

*  Filter the flights data frame to isolate the flights from JFK during April
*  Create a scatterplot
*  Use jittering and transparency to help with the overplotting.
*  Smooth with the default method (generalized additive model)
*  Smooth with a linear regression

![Desired result shown above.](http://govfinance.byu.edu/govfinance/classes/dataScience/homework/graphs/HW05.png)

1.  What might explain the clusters of points in the scatterplot?
2.  Is the relationship linear?
