```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Concepts  

1.  Compare and contrast filter and select.  

2.  Explain how ":" can be used when selecting variables.  

## Interpretation of code  

```{r code chunk interpretation}
flights %>%
  mutate(
    hours = dep_time %/% 100,
    minutes = dep_time %% 100,
    minutes_after_midnight = 60 * hours + minutes
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = origin,
             x = minutes_after_midnight,
             fill = origin)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE)
```

## Write your own code

1.  Select only those flights going from JFK to Chicago (ORD).
1.  Include the following variables: dep_delay and arr_delay. 
1.  Rename the variables dep_delay to departure and arr_delay to arrival.
1.  Draw a scatterplot of arrival on departure with colored loess and linear regression smoothers without confidence intervals.

## Extra Coding Problem **(optional)**

Use mutate and the ranking function to find the 5 most delayed flights departing from JFK.

1. Choose the flights departing from JFK
1. Create a new variable called delay which is the rank of the departure delay with 1 being the longest delay.
1. For the five most delayed flights, print the new variable delay along with origin, year, month, day, dest, carrier, and dep_delay with the most delayed at the top of the table.
