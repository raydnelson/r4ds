## Concepts  

Explain how aesthetics, scaling, and mapping are related to each other within the context of the grammar of graphcs and ggplot.  

## Interpretation of code

```{r code chunk, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE,
              color = "black",
              size = 0.50) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(class))
```  

## Draw a proportional bar chart for class of vehicle (class), drive train (drv), and year

1.  Put class on the x axis
1.  Fill the bars based on the drive
1.  Use facet_grid to create a graph for 1999 and 2008.

```{r facets}

```
