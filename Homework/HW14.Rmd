```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Concepts

1.  Give two original examples of functions where you have the function name as a verb and the arguments as nouns.

2.  Explain why style is important when you are writing functions.

3.  What is meant by snake_case and camelCase when you are writing functions?

## Interpretation of code

Interpret the following R code chunk:

```{r code chunk interpretation}
graph_dest_hours <- function(dest_airport){
flights %>% 
  filter(dest == dest_airport) %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, fill = origin)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24), labels = seq(0, 24)) +
  labs(
    title = paste("New York City Flights to", dest_airport),
    x = "Hour of the day",
    y = "Number of flights",
    fill = "New York Airport"
  )  
}

graph_dest_hours("LAX")
```

## Write Code

Create a function that takes as an argument the origin airport in the flights tibble that will to accomplish the following

1.  Remove observations with missing values for dep_time
2.  Select all departing flights for origin airport
3.  Calculate the hour from sched_dep_time using integer division
4.  Draw a bar chart for the new hour variable
5.  Recreate the labeling for the graph

Run your function for the JFK airport. It should generate a graph like the following:

```{r departure function}

```
