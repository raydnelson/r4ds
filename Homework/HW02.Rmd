```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Concepts  

Explain how aesthetics, scaling, and mapping are related to each other within the context of the grammar of graphcs and ggplot. 

Write your answer here.

## Interpretation of code

```{r code chunk, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), method = "lm", se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(drv))
``` 

Write your answer here.

## Write your own code

Draw a scatterplot of linear regressions of city mileage on displacement

1.  Put displ on the x-axis
1.  Put cty on the y-axis
1.  Color the plot symbols by class
1.  Draw a simple regression line for each car class without a confidence interval
1.  Use facet_wrap to create a graph for each class
1.  Suppress the legend
