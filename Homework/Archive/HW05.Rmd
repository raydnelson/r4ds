## Concepts

Explain the sequence whereby a word file is created from a R Markdown document. What is the purpose of the YAML header?

## Interpretation of R Markdown code

### New lines and paragraphs can be very confusing. This is one of the most inconsistent and confusing parts of R Markdown.

When using R Markdown, you insert a new line by putting two spaces and a carriage return at the end of your text.  
A new paragraph requires two carriage returns.

R Markdown allows you to have italics, bold, and code

* *italics*
* **bold**
* `code`. (A monospaced font is usually used for code.)

### Include graphics

### You can create your own graphics like this one that compares highway mpg for different class and drive train combinations.

```{r distribution of mpg by auto class and drive train}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy, fill = class)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(drv))
```  

You can also use include tables  

# Number of Students in *MPA 634: Data Science for Managers*

MBA        | 2
MISM       | 6
MPA        | 8

## Write your own code

Write RMarkdown code that creates the following document. You don't need another YAML header and setup R chunk because they are already part of this R Markdown document.
