```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Concepts  

Define and explain each of the seven parts of the layered grammar of graphics.

## Interpretation of code

```{r code chunk, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(vars(color), ncol = 1)
```  

## Write your own code

Using the mpg tibble, draw a proportional bar chart for class of vehicle (class), drive train (drv), and year

1.  Put class on the x axis.
1.  Color the bars based on the drive.
1.  Use position to convert the proportional bar chart.
1.  Use facet_grid to create a graph for 1999 and 2008.
