```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)

```

## Concepts  

Define and explain each of the seven parts of the layered grammar of graphics.

## Interpretation of code

```{r code chunk}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(vars(drv), ncol = 1)
```  

## Write your own code

## Using the mpg tibble, draw a smoothed scatterplot for each different drive train.

1.  Put displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis.
2.  Color the points in the scatterplots by the class of the vehicle.
3.  Use facet_grid to create a graph for each different type of drive train.
4.  Draw the smoothed line for all of the points in each subplot.
5.  Suppress the confidence interval on the loess smoothed line.
