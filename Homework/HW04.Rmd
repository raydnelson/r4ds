## Code Interpretation

Problem #1 Diamonds

```{r dodged bar chart}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = cut, fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral") +
  labs(
    title = "Most diamonds in this data set have an ideal cut.",
    subtitle = "Diamonds is a tidyverse data set",
    y = "Cut of Diamond",
    x = "Number of Diamonds"
  )
```

Problem #2  MPG
```{r stacked bar chart}
mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_infreq(drv), fill = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  labs(
    title = "Rear wheel drive vehicles constitute the least frequent occurence.",
    subtitle = "MPG internal tidyverse data set",
    fill = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Type of Drive Train",
    x = "Number of Vehicles"
  )
```

## Coding

Problem 1

* Use the mpg data frame
* Vertical bar chart based on the class of vehicle
* Fill the bars based on the type of drive train
* Scale colors using brewer palette "Accent"
* Add the labels and titles as shown

```

Problem 2

* Diamonds data frame
* Horizontal bar chart of cut
* Fill each bar based on the color of the diamond
* Scale fill using brewer palette "Pastel1"
* Add the labels and titles as shown
