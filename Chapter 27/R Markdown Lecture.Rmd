# R Markdown basics

  1.  YAML header and setup code chunk 
  1.  Text and formatting 
  1.  Code chunks  

## YAML header and initial code chunk

The following YAML header sets up an html document to have the code available but hidden:

`title: "R Markdown"`  
`author: "Developers at RStudio"`  
`date: "9/16/2019"`
`output:`  
`html_document:`  
`code_folding: hide`
    
The setup code chunk often contains libraries.  

`{r setup, include = FALSE}`  
`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)`  
`library(tidyverse)`  

## Text and formatting

### Purposes of R Markdown as proposed by Grolemund and Wickham *(Here is an example of an ordered list.)*

1.  Communicate with decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.
4.  Collaborate with other data scientists (including the future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).
2.  Provide an environment suitable for data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

### Resources

### Equations

#### Inline

This is the quadratic equation: ${{ - b \pm \sqrt {{b^2} - 4ac} } \over {2a}}$


#### Display for quadratic equation

$${{ - b \pm \sqrt {{b^2} - 4ac} } \over {2a}}$$


### Tables using R Markdown

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

## Code Chunks

### Inline

The number of rows in the mtcars tibble is: `r nrow(mtcars)`.

### Display

Scatterplot of highway miles per gallon on engine displacement    
Built-in mpg R data set

```{r mpg versus wt}
  ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(color = "red", alpha = 0.5) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "lightgreen", se = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "lightblue", se = FALSE) +
    labs(
      title = "The relationship between highway mileage and displacement is not linear",
      x = "Liters",
      y = "Miles Per Gallon"
    )
```  

Because of the nonlinear pattern, transformations such as those we will cover in Chapter 5 will be appropriate and desirable.

### Tables using R code

```{r table example}
head(mtcars, 5)
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```
