Downloading the document from github isn't quite straight-forward because you need to remember to copy the raw file. Otherwise it doesn't come in quite correctly.

```{r create file smaller, echo = FALSE}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```
  
We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r look at the distribution of small diamond sizes, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```  

There seems to be rounding in the weight of the diamonds as they clump around certain values.
