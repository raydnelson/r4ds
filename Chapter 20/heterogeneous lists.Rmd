## Lists can contain many types of information

### Create objects

```{r variety of objects}
Logical <- 1:10 %% 3 == 0 # Those numbers between 1 and 10 that are divisible by 3
Integer <- 10L
Double <- 10
Numeric <- list(Integer, Double)
Character <- "Data Science"
```

### Create a list

```{r create the list called variety}
variety <-
  list(
    one = Logical,
    two = Numeric,
    three = Character,
    four = mpg
  )
```

### Investigate the structure of variety

```{r structure of variety}
str(variety)
length(variety)
names(variety)
```  

### Access the list

```{r accessing the list}
variety$one
variety[[1]]
variety[1]

variety$four
variety$four$hwy
variety[[4]]
variety[[4]]$hwy
variety$four[[9]]
