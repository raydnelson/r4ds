Submit an R Markdown for the following two problems. In order to get full credit, your R Markdown document must knit properly.  

## Problem 1

Please write code that completes the following:

*  Create a new variable for the departure hour from the scheduled departure time variable
*  Calculate the number of flights that leave during each hour and each airport
*  Draw a bar chart for each of the three New York airports
*  Color the bars based on their origin airport
*  It is not required that your graph replicate the graph labels. We will cover that in Chapter 28.

## Problem 2

Please write code that completes the following:

*  Determine the number of destinations for each NYC airport
*  Create a bar chart that depicts the number of destinations
*  Color the bars based on the departure airport
*  Order the bars from smallest to largest number of destinations (This is called a Pareto Chart)
*  It is not required that your graph replicate the graph labels. We will cover that in Chapter 28.
