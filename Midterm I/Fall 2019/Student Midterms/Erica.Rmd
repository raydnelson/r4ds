```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## I think there is a way to combine the steps in this next chunk but I couldn't figure it out.

```{r}
destinations <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% c("ATL", "BOS"))

arrivals <- destinations %>% 
  filter(arr_time, (abs(sched_arr_time - arr_time) <= 30))
```

## Here is the code for the graph

```{r}
arrivals %>% 
ggplot(aes(origin, arr_delay)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = origin), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.25, fill = "grey") +
  facet_grid("dest") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "First Coding Problem",
    subtitle = "NYC 2013 Flights Within 30 Minutes of Scheduled Arrival",
    x = "Origin",
    y = "Arrival Delay")
```

### I don't know why LGA's flights to BOS are short
