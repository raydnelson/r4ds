## Problem 1

Please write code that completes the following:

*  Create a new variable called departure hour from the scheduled departure time variable
*  Calculate the number of flights that leave during each hour and each airport
*  Draw a bar chart for each of the three New York airports
*  Don't worry about replicating the graph labels. We will cover that in Chapter 28

```{r problem 1}

```

## Problem 2

Please write code that completes the following:

*  Determine the number of destinations for each NYC airport
*  Create a bar chart that depicts the number of destinations
*  Order the bars from smallest to largest number of destinations  
   (This is called a Pareto Chart)

```{r Problem 2}
